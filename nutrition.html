            <h2>The Importance of Balanced Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Eating a variety of foods ensures your body gets the vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, and healthy fats it needs. A balanced diet helps maintain a healthy weight, boosts energy levels, supports the immune system, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases.</p>

            <h2>Key Food Groups</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
    <strong>Vegetables & Fruits:</strong> 
    These provide essential vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber that help the body function properly and strengthen the immune system. 
    For a balanced meal, aim to fill at least half of your plate with a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables.
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Whole Grains:</strong> 
    Whole grains supply long-lasting energy and fiber, which helps with digestion and keeps you full for longer. 
    Examples include brown rice, oats, whole wheat bread, and whole grain cereals.
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Proteins:</strong> 
    Proteins are important for body growth, muscle repair, and overall development. 
    Healthy sources include lean meat, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, and nuts.
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Dairy or Alternatives:</strong> 
    These foods help build strong bones and teeth because they are rich in calcium and vitamin D. 
    Options include milk, yogurt, cheese, or plant-based alternatives such as soy or almond milk.
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> 
    Healthy fats support brain function and heart health. 
    They can be found in foods like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, and should be consumed in moderate amounts.
</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Practical Tips for Healthy Eating</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Plan meals ahead to avoid impulsive unhealthy choices.</li>
                <li>Drink plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
                <li>Limit processed foods, added sugars, and excessive salt.</li>
                <li>Practice portion control – listen to your body's hunger cues.</li>
              <li>
    Include a variety of colorful foods on your plate, such as green vegetables, red fruits, and yellow or orange foods. 
    Different colors provide different nutrients, so eating a “rainbow” helps your body get a wide range of vitamins and minerals.
</li>

            </ol>

            <p>Small consistent changes in eating habits can lead to significant long-term health benefits.</p>
