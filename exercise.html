            <h2>Why Exercise Matters</h2>
            <p>Physical activity helps control weight, reduces the risk of heart disease, strengthens bones and muscles, improves mental health, and boosts energy levels. Even moderate exercise can make a big difference in daily life.</p>

            <h2>Types of Exercise</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aerobic (Cardio):</strong> Activities that increase heart rate (e.g., walking, running, swimming, cycling).</li>
                <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Builds muscle and bone density (e.g., weight lifting, bodyweight exercises like push-ups and squats).</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Improves range of motion (e.g., stretching, yoga).</li>
                <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Helps prevent falls, especially important as we age (e.g., tai chi, standing on one foot).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Recommendations and Tips</h2>
            <p>Health experts recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, plus muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Start small – even a 10-minute walk counts.</li>
                <li>Choose activities you enjoy to stay motivated.</li>
                <li>Mix different types for balanced fitness.</li>
                <li>Warm up before and cool down after exercising.</li>
                <li>Listen to your body and rest when needed.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Making exercise a regular habit leads to long-term health benefits and greater well-being.</p>
