            <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
            <p>This website was developed as an individual academic project to demonstrate proficiency in web design and development using standard technologies. The goal is to promote awareness of healthy living by providing simple, reliable information on key areas of wellness: nutrition, exercise, mental health, and sleep.</p>
            
            <p>All content is educational and based on widely accepted health guidelines. It is intended to encourage positive lifestyle habits and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.</p>

            <h2>About the Developer</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Mensah Lawson Addae , and I am a student currently studying web development and related technologies. This project was created entirely by me using manual coding techniques with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript – no WYSIWYG tools were used.</p>
            
            <p>I chose the topic of healthy living because maintaining balance in physical and mental health is important for everyone. I hope this site provides useful tips and motivates visitors to make small, positive changes in their daily lives.</p>
